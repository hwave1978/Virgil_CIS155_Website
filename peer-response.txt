My website needed a lot of overhaul, so i continued working to fix it in order to make it appear like a website.  I did take Stephanie's suggestions and implement them. 

1.) Enhancing the navigation bar by incorporating a Resource and a Project Timeline page could improve user experience and accessibility. Including the seasonal timeline and benefits is helpful with projects like this (thinking pros/cons). I appreciate that you incorporated physical environmental elements when considering the project, i.e., where the sun is and what you use the space for.

*Suggestions fo improvement: Enhancing the navigation bar by incorporating a Resource and a Project Timeline.  I improved the timeline by titling the phases, and incorporating Phases I-IV.

2nd suggestion: 
2.) For the header (#A_Visual): use a font weight of 600 instead of 5250 for standard weight scaling. 

* This was a suggestion that Staphanie pointed out that was implemented. For some reason I had the font set at 5250.  The change was implemented to the A Visual Journey of a Landscape Project.

By the time I looked at Jace's suggestions I had already progressed on the website and, from what I see, the screen flex's as it should when minimized.








Jace Martinez peer review of my website:

This is a peer review for Virgil Beasley.

I really enjoyed your site! I did not expect websites to look this good this early. The links to other sites are helpful.

Things to improve.

1. I noticed that on the first page, the images do not change in size to accommodate a larger screen. Your photos on the other 2 pages do though!

2. On page 2 on the right column, some of these photos were taken vertically. I think it would help to have pairs of these photos next to each other horizontally to allow room for them to expand to allow better visuals for the viewer.

3. I just realized that when I scroll over some of these photos, they zoom in! Thats great. I recommend increasing the zoom on the smaller images. Being able to see all these photos showing the Lanscaping will really help tell this story.




Stephanie Vezina peer review of my website:

The design and navigation are straightforward. The images and content add personality, and the links for resources and inspiration are helpful. This very impressive hobby demands a lot of labor and a mindful skillset... are you taking clients? ;)

3.) Navigation (#nav_menu): Use display: flex; justify-content: center; for centered navigation items.
