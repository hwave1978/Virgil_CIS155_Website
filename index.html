            This website is a place where I will be posting the photographs I have taken through the years during the
            landscaping transformation of my home's front and backyard. I hope to motivate others with my journey and
            share tips and insights on improving curb appeal and creating beautiful outdoor spaces for your home. Here
            are some tips to get started:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Create a sketch to plan the layout of your garden, including garden beds, pathways, and seating areas.
            </li>
            <li>
                Observe how sunlight moves across your yard to choose the best plant locations.
            </li>
            <li>
                Plan spaces for activities, such as play areas, gardens, or relaxation spots.
            </li>
            <li>
                Incorporate existing features into your layout. Trees, bushes, fences, and other structures already in
                place.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Getting started with landscaping can feel overwhelming, but it's a fun and rewarding process. Think about how you want your outdoor space to look and what you'd like to do in it. Whether you want a colorful flower garden, an outdoor seating area, or a play space for kids, having a clear plan makes a big difference. Taking the first step like sketching your layout and considering where the sun shines can help you create a beautiful space.
