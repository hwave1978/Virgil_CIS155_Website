            This website is a place where I will be posting the photographs I have taken through the years during the landscaping transformation of my home's front and backyard. I hope to motivate others with my              journey and share tips and insights on improving curb appeal and creating beautiful outdoor spaces for your home.  Here are some tips to get started:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Create a sketch to plan the layout of your garden, including garden beds, pathways, and seating areas.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Observe how sunlight moves across your yard to choose the best plant locations.  
                </li>
                <li>
                    Plan spaces for activities, such as play areas, gardens, or relaxation spots.
                </li>  
                <li>
                    Incorporate existing features into your layout. Trees, bushes, fences, and other structures already in place.
                </li>
            </ul>
